# hello-world-tracker
Trying to setup a repo with Pivotal Tracker

Making changes so that I have something to commit and see
if it gets pushed to Tracker...

Making yet more changes for another test...

I think I now have the streamlined demo experience for how to do test this
quickly..  this test will determine if I am right...
